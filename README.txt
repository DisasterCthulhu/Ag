This was an attempt to write myself a git based on https://wyag.thb.lt/ in LPC

Overall this has been a great learning experience, and shown me some failures of the specifics of even the classic git implmentaiton and LPC as a language, in combination.

It's been a while since I worked on this, but lack of binary reading of files, reading through nulls, sha(various) support were some of the issues encountered.

Mostly posted for posterity at this point, it's not complete enough to be usable, and the security model makes it extemely difficulty to properly implement.
